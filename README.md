## Running locally

A nodejs >= 10.0.0 setup with yarn is recommended.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# build for production
yarn build

# run production build locally (you must run `yarn build` at least once)
yarn start

# run tests (lint + type check)
yarn test
```
